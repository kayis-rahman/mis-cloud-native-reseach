## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
```bash
# Check node resource usage
kubectl top nodes

# Check pod resource usage
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces

# Check SSD performance
kubectl exec -it <prometheus-pod> -- df -h

# Monitor application response times in Grafana
# Prometheus metrics: http_request_duration_seconds
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **API Gateway Response Time**: Target <100ms (vs >200ms on budget config)
- **Database Query Time**: Target <50ms (vs >150ms on standard disk)
- **Container Startup**: Target <30s (vs >60s on standard disk)
- **Monitoring Lag**: Target <15s (vs 30s delay)
